   - Click "Download Icons" 
   - Save `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` to the project root

## Option 1: Local Testing with Live Server (Easiest)

### On Windows:

   ```bash
   npm install -g live-server
   ```

2. **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Destiny\iCloudDrive\Documents\AI Tools\Anthropic Solution\Projects\JobBoardPWA"
   live-server --port=8080
   ```

3. **Find your computer's IP address**
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

4. **On your phone**
   - Connect to the same WiFi network
   - Open Chrome/Safari
   - Navigate to: `http://YOUR_IP:8080`

## Option 2: Using Python Simple Server

1. **Start Python server**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\Destiny\iCloudDrive\Documents\AI Tools\Anthropic Solution\Projects\JobBoardPWA"
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Access on phone**

## Option 3: Using ngrok (Access from anywhere)

2. **Start local server** (using any method above)

3. **Create tunnel**

   - This works from any network!

## Option 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Permanent)

2. **Push your code**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial PWA commit"
   git remote add origin YOUR_REPO_URL
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**
