# How Job Hunter PWA Works

## üîç Job Scraping Process

### Current Implementation (Demo)
The app currently uses sample job data for demonstration purposes. The jobs are hardcoded with realistic data structures that would come from actual job boards.

### Production Implementation
In a production environment, the job scraping would work as follows:

1. **API Integration**
   - Connect to job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, AngelList, etc.)
   - Use OAuth authentication for secure access
   - Fetch job listings based on user preferences

2. **Web Scraping Techniques**
   - For sites without APIs, use headless browser automation
   - Parse HTML using DOM selectors
   - Extract structured data from job listings

3. **Data Extraction**
   ```javascript
   // Example extraction logic
   const extractJobData = (html) => ({
     title: html.querySelector('.job-title').textContent,
     company: html.querySelector('.company-name').textContent,
     description: html.querySelector('.job-description').innerHTML,
     requirements: Array.from(html.querySelectorAll('.requirement')).map(r => r.textContent),
     salary: html.querySelector('.salary-range')?.textContent || 'Not specified',
     location: html.querySelector('.location').textContent
   });
   ```

4. **Data Storage**
   - Store in IndexedDB for offline access
   - Periodic background sync to update listings
   - Deduplicate jobs across sources

## üéØ Resume Optimization Algorithm

The resume optimization process analyzes job requirements and intelligently modifies your resume:

### 1. Keyword Extraction
```javascript
// Extract key technical skills and requirements
const extractKeywords = (job) => {
  const keywords = [];
  
  // Direct requirements
  keywords.push(...job.requirements);
  
  // Parse description for technical terms
  const techTerms = job.description.match(/\b(React|Python|AWS|Docker|etc)\b/gi);
  keywords.push(...new Set(techTerms));
  
  return keywords;
};
```

### 2. Resume Enhancement
- **Keyword Injection**: Adds a "CORE COMPETENCIES" section with relevant skills
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Capitalizes matching keywords throughout the resume
- **Objective Tailoring**: Creates job-specific objective statement
- **Section Reordering**: Prioritizes relevant experience

### 3. Optimization Example
**Before:**
```

## üìù AI-Powered Cover Letter Generation

The cover letter generation uses intelligent analysis of job descriptions:

### 1. Content Analysis
```javascript
const analyzejobContent = (job) => {
  const analysis = {
    isTechFocused: /innovative|cutting-edge|technology/i.test(job.description),
    isTeamOriented: /team|collaborate|work together/i.test(job.description),
    isGrowthFocused: /growth|learn|develop/i.test(job.description),
    companyTone: detectCompanyTone(job.description)
  };
  return analysis;
};
```

### 2. Dynamic Content Generation
- **Personalized Opening**: Mentions specific position and company
- **Skill Matching**: Highlights relevant experience based on requirements
- **Cultural Fit**: Adjusts tone based on company culture indicators
- **Call to Action**: Professional closing with next steps

### 3. Example Output
